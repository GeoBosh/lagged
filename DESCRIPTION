Description: Provides classes and methods for objects, whose indexing
      naturally starts from zero. Subsetting, indexing and mathematical
      operations are defined naturally between lagged objects and lagged
      and base R objects. Recycling is not used, except for singletons.
      The single bracket operator doesn't drop dimensions by default.
